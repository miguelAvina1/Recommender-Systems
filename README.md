### Prerequisites ###

* R
* Web browser

### Overview ###

This project analyzes the [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Restaurant+%26+consumer+data)
from the IC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This data can also be found
under the RCdata folder of this repository.

The project follows the steps described in the [Instructions](https://github.com/miguelAvina1/Recommender-Systems/tree/master/Instructions/Tarea_Sistemas_de_Recomendacion.pdf)
 provided.

*  **"RecommSystems.Rmd"** is an R notebook describing each step of the
 homework along with the R instructions used. We created this file to help the
 reader follow our rationale and the approaches we took while doing this exercise.
 It also describes assumptions and our interpretations to the results.

*  **"RecommSystems.nb.html"** is the compiled version of the .Rmd file ready to be
 read in any browser or html viewer.

*  **"RecommSystems.R"** is the R script for this exercise. This file might be
 useful to have a more compact view of the code. Comments for most of the
 sections are provided. However, we strongly suggest to read RecommeSystems.Rmd
 for broader explanations.

* **"IS_RecommSystem.Rproj"** is the R-Studio project.
